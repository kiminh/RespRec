These details are too early. Not very proper for introductions.


Ditto, introduction is more about the problem itself, the existing literature, why solving the problem is very important (motivation), and what's the challenge of solving it.

For your methods, only overview is fine. Details are all in following sections.


Try to use clear concepts/terms and short sentences.

When I read it, I don't know what are the existing bi-level approaches. What do you mean by "oscillating the inner-level"? Why it must leads to poor accuracy.

When explaining stuff, either explain them crystal clear, or use straightforward words everybody understands without ambiguity although can be inaccurate, or simply don't explain them.


These claims without proper justifications are more suitable for conclusions.

Here in Intro, better just say the problem, the challenge, how we solve it. No need to stress too much what's the end result of the solution. Otherwise it simply sets a too high expectation, and makes me feels the authors are overconfident.


This part needs more elaborations. I doubt many readers/reviewers would like to buy it without questioning.


Just put Bayes' rule here. Later name the probabilities to \alpha, \beta etc.

Better still use conditional/probability symbols, these greek letters are hard to remember their meanings.


No, they will be paid.

Can say "hiring" or "letting" or "choosing"


Still think these notations are hard to understand.


This is simply too long.

Break it into 2 or 3 sentences.

One sentence should not go across more than 4 lines (or even 3).


Is r continuous?
Otherwise use some integer formulas.


are

Try to avoid such minor but obvious errors.


and?



These models read like existing approaches, rather than required knowledge to read this paper.


Ditto, still existing related work.



This is too detailed, reads like detailed implementation.

Many people will get lost when reading at this an early stage of the paper.

Give it a different name, or simply explain it with something everyone understands and doesn't need to think, or don't even explain it, use the inaccurate but straight forward way that everyone thinks it should be and if you really want to be accurate then use a short footnote.


Can use two separate (sub)sections to discuss "existing approaches" and "their drawbacks".

In the "their drawbacks" section, the point is not to criticize existing approaches, but to show your readers the challenge to solve this problem (letting them be curious how we innovatively resolve these challenges.
